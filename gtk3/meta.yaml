# Gtk+ 3 needs to be built on at least CentOS 6, since it requires XInput
# version 2 and CentOS 5 only has version 1. However, one must be careful to
# build it against dependent packages that were built on CentOS 5 -- in
# particular, when building cairo-gobject on CentOS 6, the resulting shared
# library gets a dependency on xcb, which propagates its way into the Gtk+
# shared libraries.
