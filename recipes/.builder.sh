# This script is run inside the standardized Docker container to build a Conda
# package. We keep it separate from the container so that we don't need to
# make a whole new container just to adjust the builder script. We are run
# from the 'recipes' directory, and the argument is a fully-qualified path to
# the directory with the recipe we're supposed to build.
#
# The only interesting thing we do is copy files to a temporary directory
# since "conda build" slurps everything in the recipe directory into the built
# package, including tilde backup files, etc.
