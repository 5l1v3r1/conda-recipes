# Ugh. This package is necessary because the OS X version of the "qt" package
# doesn't include the DBus subsystem, which is likely because dbus-c++ is
# highly horked and does not build cleanly on OS X. See build.sh for an
# explanation of how we go about this. The code here is derived from the "qt"
# recipe in conda/conda-recipes on GitHub.
