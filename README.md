conda-recipes
=============

This repository contains recipes for building various packages in the [Conda]
package manager used by the [Anaconda] Python distribution. Most of them build
up to providing support for the [Gtk+ 3] graphical toolkit and the [CASA]
radio interferometry package. Builds are only tested on Linux.

[Conda]: http://conda.pydata.org/
[Anaconda]: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index
[Gtk+ 3]: http://www.gtk.org/
[CASA]: http://casa.nrao.edu/

I upload built packages to [my personal anaconda.org channel]. You can
configure your [Anaconda] installation to fetch packages from it with:

```
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/pkgw/channel/main
```

To directly install the package `pwkit` (for example) without altering your
configuration, use:

```
conda install -c pkgw pwkit
```
