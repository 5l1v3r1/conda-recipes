conda-recipes
=============

These files give recipes for building various packages in the [Conda] package
manager. Most of them build up to providing support for the [Gtk+ 3] graphical
toolkit. Builds are only tested on Linux.

[Conda]: http://conda.pydata.org/
[Gtk+ 3]: http://www.gtk.org/

I upload built packages to [my personal Binstar channel]. You can configure
your [Conda] installation to fetch packages from it with:

```
conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/pkgw/channel/main
```
