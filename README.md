conda-recipes
=============

This repository contains recipes for building various packages in the [Conda]
package manager. Most of them build up to providing support for the [Gtk+ 3]
graphical toolkit. Builds are only tested on Linux.

[Conda]: http://conda.pydata.org/
[Gtk+ 3]: http://www.gtk.org/

I upload built packages to [my personal anaconda.org channel]. You can
configure your [Anaconda] installation to fetch packages from it with:

```
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/pkgw/channel/main
```

Docs for Packagers and Builders
===============================

This repository also includes some notes on packaging software for the [Conda]
system and how to build those packages.
